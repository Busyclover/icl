# Abstract

# Introduction

## Background (TODO lit summary)

TODO: Start out with summary of TfL finances, then move on to brief literature summary of papers reviewed to date.

## Analytical Objective

This work sought to use graph-theoretical [@_graph_2016] methods for modelling the Transport for London ("TfL") Underground network. More explicitly, the aim was to investigate the creation of fare zones using a data-driven approach, and to compare the results of such approaches with the fare zones that exist today. Such comparisons were made in both financial terms, as well as using theoretical measures proposed in earlier work [@yang_defining_2015]. 

TODO: Describe two approaches. Go in to detail and provide the context

TODO: There are a range of community detection algorithms, each with varying performance characteristics [@lancichinetti_community_2009]. Such algorithms can be used to detect and label groups of "similar" nodes in a graph (with the definition of similarity varying across the algorithms). Typically, 

Typically, However, some of these algorithms have the advantage of being 

## Data Used

The following data were obtained and used for the purposes of the analysis conducted in this assignment:

* Transport for London Underground Station adjacency, fare zone and line information available as open-source data hosted on [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_geographic_maps/CSV#Routes) [-@wikimedia_london_2009]. Referred to as the "raw graph structure data"; 
* Transport for London Underground inter-station distances [@tfl_distances_2013], made available by Transport for London under a Freedom of Information request in [2013](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/distances_between_adjacent_oyste). Referred to as the "distances data"; and
* Sample journey data provided by Transport for London [-@tfl_oyster_2009]. The data cover 5% of all Oyster card journeys made in one week in November 2009. The data are available through the Transport for London [API](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds#on-this-page-6). Referred to as the "journey data".

# Methodology



## Graph creation

### Load and clean linkage data

The raw graph structure [@wikimedia_london_2009] and the distances data [@tfl_distances_2013] were loaded and some basic processing and cleaning (e.g. standardisation of the names of stations) was performed.


```r
# Load the data ----------------------------------------------------------------
### Graph structure
# Basic linkage data from Wiki
adjacency <- read_csv("./data/geo/adjacency.csv",
                      col_types = cols(station1 = col_integer(),
                                       station2 = col_integer(),
                                       line = col_integer()))

# Line lookup values
station_lk <- read_csv("./data/geo/station_lk.csv",
                       col_types = cols(line = col_integer(),
                                        name = col_character(),
                                        colour = col_character(),
                                        stripe = col_character()))

# Station details
station_details <- read_csv("./data/geo/stations_geo.csv",
                            col_types = cols(id = col_integer(),

                                             rail = col_integer()))

# Clean the data ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Set up clean lower-case name, and rounded zone-number in station details
station_details <- station_details %>% mutate(name_cln = tolower(name),
                                              zone_cln = ceiling(zone))

           station1 = str_trim(station1),
           station2 = str_trim(station2))

# Clean up DLR distances table
dlr_dist_long <- dlr_dist %>% gather(station, dist, -Metres) %>% 
    rename(from = Metres,
           to = station) %>% 
    left_join(dlr_abbr, by = c("from" = "abbr")) %>%

           line = "Docklands Light Railway") %>% 
    select(line, station1, station2, dist) %>% 
    ungroup()

# Clean up station-station distances table
station_dist_long <- stations_dist %>% 
    group_by(Line, `Station from (A)`, `Station to (B)`) %>% 
    summarise(dist = median(`Distance (Kms)`)) %>% 
    rename(line = Line,

distances <- bind_rows(dlr_dist_long, station_dist_long) %>% 
    mutate(station1 = tolower(station1),
           station2 = tolower(station2),
           station1 = str_trim(station1),
           station2 = str_trim(station2),
           station1 = gsub("edgware", "edgeware", station1),
           station2 = gsub("edgware", "edgeware", station2),
           station1 = gsub("regents park", "regent's park", station1),
           station2 = gsub("regents park", "regent's park", station2),
           station1 = gsub("piccadilly", "picadilly", station1),

           station1 = gsub("kings cross|kings cross st pancras", "king's cross st. pancras", station1),
           station2 = gsub("kings cross|kings cross st pancras", "king's cross st. pancras", station2),

           station2 = gsub("st pauls", "st. paul's", station2))
```

After ensuring that (wherever possible) all station-station distances were present, these data were joined with the data of the graph structure. The graph structure _data_ was then transformed in to a graph _object_, retaining the distance between adjacent stations as an edge attribute.


```r
# Create "reversed" distances to account for possible different combos of stations
distances <- bind_rows(distances, distances %>% 
                           select(line, station2, station1, dist) %>% 
                           rename(station3 = station1,
                                  station1 = station2) %>% 
                           rename(station2 = station3))

# Add distances to station linkages data
links <- links %>% 
    left_join(distances %>% select(-line), by = c("station1" = "station1",
                                "station2" = "station2"))

# Clean up missing distances - set to average
links <- links %>%
    mutate(dist = round(ifelse(is.na(dist), 
                               mean(links$dist, na.rm = T), 
                               dist),
                        2)) %>% 
    distinct()


# Create "reversed" links to account for bi-directional travel!
links <- bind_rows(links, links %>% 
                            select(line, station2, station1, dist) %>% 
                            rename(station3 = station1,
                                   station1 = station2) %>% 
                            rename(station2 = station3))

# Clean up intermediate tables)
rm(dlr_abbr, dlr_dist, dlr_dist_long, station_dist_long, adjacency, distances,
   stations_dist)

# Chop out line and distinct
graph_data <- links %>% 
    distinct() %>% 
    select(-line)

# Make the graph - retain distance as edge attribute but do not weight edges
tfl_graph <- graph_data %>% 
    graph_from_data_frame(directed = TRUE)

# Clean up

```

### Estimate journey routes

In order to model the graph structure more correctly, it was necessary to estimate routes taken through the network based on sample journey data. These routes could then be used to correctly weight edges in the graph based on the number of journeys occurring between nodes (i.e. very popular trips would be highly weighted). The sample of Oyster journeys [@tfl_oyster_2009] was loaded and filtered. These data contained a sample of _all_ journeys made with an Oyster card in one week of November 2009 (including bus journeys). As such these data were filtered to include only those journeys made on the London Underground, and only those that were fully pay-as-you-go (i.e. not using a daily/weekely/monthly travelcard). 


```r
# Usage data
journeys <- read_csv("./data/journeys/Nov09JnyExport.csv",
                     col_types = cols(downo = col_integer(),
                                      daytype = col_character(),
                                      SubSystem = col_character(),
                                      StartStn = col_character(),
                                      EndStation = col_character(),
                                      EntTime = col_integer(),
                                      EntTimeHHMM = col_character(),
                                      ExTime = col_integer(),
                                      EXTimeHHMM = col_character(),
                                      ZVPPT = col_character(),
                                      JNYTYP = col_character(),
                                      DailyCapping = col_character(),
                                      FFare = col_integer(),
                                      DFare = col_integer(),
                                      RouteID = col_character(),
                                      FinalProduct = col_character()))
names(journeys) <- names(journeys) %>% tolower()

# Filter to just completed tube journeys that were PAYG
journeys <- journeys %>%
     filter(subsystem == "LUL",
            startstn != "Unstarted",
            endstation != "Unfinished",
            endstation != "Not Applicable",
            finalproduct == "PAYG")
```

Further cleaning and standardisation of station names was performed to ensure that they matched those present in the graph structure data.

# Add on ID-information and zone

    left_join(station_details %>% select(name_cln, id, zone_cln), 
              by = c("start_cln" = "name_cln")) %>%

```

The journey data only provided the start and end point of the overall journey, and not the route taken. Therefore, it was necessary to approximate the route. This was done by applying Dijkstra's [-@dijkstra_note_1959] algorithm to the intial graph structure, weighting the edges by the distance between them. Whilst this method did not neccessarily return the _exact_ route taken on each journey, it provided a useful approximation in the absence of such data.

In order to computationally simplify this step, popular (e.g. Oxford Circus to Victoria) journeys in this sample data were de-duplicated, ensuring that a route for a particular journey was only calculated once. A simple function was defined to apply the algorithm and return the vertex path in an ordered list (where the first element is the starting station, the second element the second station, and so on up to the final station). 


```r
# Dedupe journeys
distinct_journeys <- journeys %>% select(start_cln, end_cln) %>% distinct()

# Define a function that will calcualte the path and return it as an ordered list
get_shortest_path <- function(node1, node2, graph = tfl_graph) {
    path <- shortest_paths(graph, node1, node2, weights = E(graph)$dist)$vpath
    path <- path[[1]]
    path <- path %>% as.list() %>% names()
    return(path)
}

routes <- distinct_journeys %>% 
    mutate(path = map2(start_cln, end_cln, get_shortest_path)) %>% 
    unnest(path)
```

### Aggregate routes

The routes calculated with this approach were then used to determine the number of daily trips between all adjacent stations in the graph. These daily trips were then to be used to weight the edges of the graph. 

For example, the route for a journey from Earl's Court to Pimlico was found to go from Earl's Court through Gloucester Road, South Kensington, Sloane Square, and Victoria to Pimlico. Therefore a single journey from Earl's Court to Pimlico needed to be used to add weight to several edges in the graph. 

It was therefore necessary to summarise and aggregate _journeys_ at a _route_ level in order to correctly weight the graph structure to be used for the analysis. Per journey, all pairs of adjacent stations in the path between the start and the end were determined.


```r
# Set up routes per journey   
routes <- routes %>% 
    group_by(start_cln, end_cln) %>% 
    mutate(to = lead(path, 1)) %>% 
    na.omit() %>% 
    rename(from = path)
```
   
The number of occurrences for all pairs of adjacent stations was then calculated. As the sample data covered 5% of journeys for a week long period, it was necessary to adjust the total counts to arrive at an approximate value for total daily trips between each pair of adjacent stations.


```r
# Total up all the routes and summarise trips between stations
routes <- journeys %>% 
    select(start_cln, end_cln) %>% 
    left_join(routes) %>% 
    group_by(from, to) %>% 
    summarise(daily_trips = n(),
              daily_trips = daily_trips / 7,
              daily_trips = ceiling(daily_trips * 20))
```

This summary was then joined with the graph structure data to add the daily trips between each pair of adjacent stations. Some pairs of adjacent stations in the graph structure were missing an esimation of the daily trips. This is because they were infrequently visited, outlying stations and no journeys were found to go through them. Such pairs of stations were set to have a number of trips equal to 25% of the average daily trips on their joining TfL tube line.


```r
# Join in with links data
links <- links %>% 
    left_join(routes, by = c("station1" = "from",
                                   "station2" = "to"))
## Fill in the blanks
# Find average trips per line
avg_per_line <- links %>% 
    group_by(line) %>% 
    summarise(avg_trips = mean(daily_trips, na.rm = T)*0.25)

# Fill in the blanks with a coalesce
links <- links %>% left_join(avg_per_line) %>% 
    mutate(daily_trips = coalesce(daily_trips, avg_trips)) %>% 
    select(-avg_trips)
```

### Create final graph structure

The graph object was then re-created, this time using the daily trips between adjacent stations as the edge weight attribute. A visualisation of the resulting graph structure is presented in figure 1.


```r
# Chop out line and distinct, weight by daily trips
graph_data <- links %>% 
    distinct() %>% 
    rename(weight = daily_trips) %>% 
    select(-line)

# Make the graph - retain distance as edge attribute but do not weight edges
tfl_graph <- graph_data %>% 
    graph_from_data_frame(directed = TRUE)

# Clean up
rm(graph_data)
```

#### Figure 1: TfL Underground graph structure

_The graph structure of the TfL Underground in a force directed [@kobourov_spring_2012] layout. Nodes are sized based on the number of visits per day and coloured based on the fare zone which they are assigned to. (Note: this figure is interactive)._

## Alternative zoning approaches

### Importance-based zones

#### Station importance

In order to determine the importance of a station, several common node properties were calcualted:

* __Degree__ [@opsahl_node_2010] measures the number of edges incident on a node. In this context it can be thought of as, for each station, how many other stations are connected to it directly.
* __Betweenness__ [@freeman_centrality_1979; @brandes_faster_2001] measures the number of paths going through each node. In this context it can be thought of as how likely it is that travellers will visit or pass through it on other journeys, or how much "connectivity" it provides to the network.
* __Closeness__ [@freeman_centrality_1979; @newman_scientific_2001] measures how many steps exist between each node and all other nodes in the network. In this context, it can be thought of as how central the station is in the overall network (i.e. does it lie at the end of a long branch, or close to the middle of London).
* __Eigenvector centrality__ [@bonacich_power_1987] measures the importance of a node based on how important it is, and how important its neighbours are. In this context it can be thought of as a combination of how connected a station is, and how connected its adjacent stations are.


```r
# Degree centrality
deg_cent <- degree(tfl_graph, loops = TRUE)
V(tfl_graph)$deg <- deg_cent

# Betweenness centrality
bet_cent <- betweenness(tfl_graph, directed = T)
V(tfl_graph)$bet <- bet_cent

# Closeness centrality
clo_cent <- closeness(tfl_graph)
V(tfl_graph)$close <- clo_cent

# Eigenvector centrality
eig_cent <- eigen_centrality(tfl_graph, directed = T, scale = T)
V(tfl_graph)$eig <- eig_cent$vector
```

#### Define zones

In order to define fare zones based on station importance, it was necessary to group stations together. To make these zones more comparable to their real-life equivalents a simple decile rank was applied to each measure of station importance. 


```r
# Convert to data frame of centrality stats
station_centrality_stats <- data_frame(station = names(V(tfl_graph)),
                            deg = V(tfl_graph)$deg,
                            eig = V(tfl_graph)$eig,
                            bet = V(tfl_graph)$bet,
                            clo = V(tfl_graph)$close)

station_importance_zones <- station_centrality_stats %>% 
    gather(method, value, -station) %>% 
    group_by(method) %>% 
    mutate(zone = ntile(desc(value), 10)) %>% 
    select(-value) %>% 
    spread(method, zone)
```

The real life zones were not equally distributed (i.e. there were more zone 1 stations thatn zone 10). This was not the case for the decile-ranked, importance-based zones, representing a weakness of this approach.

### Graph-community zones

#### Discovering communities

In order to define zones based on communities of stations in the graph, three alternative algorithms were used:

* __Walktrap__ [@pons_computing_2005]. This algorithm detects communities by performing random walks on the graph. The algorithm records the nodes visited in each walk and uses the results to partition the graph in to communities of nodes that frequently occurred in the same walk. In this context, such communities can be imagined to be groups of stations located in close proximity, or on the same train line.
* __Edge betweenness__ [@newman_finding_2004]. This algorithm detects communities based on the _betweeness_ metric of the edges in the graph. The algorithm iteratively removes the edge with the largest betweeness value, dividing the graph into groups and ultimately into invididual nodes. Recording this process, it uses the results to construct communities. In this context, such communities will be defined by stations which serve as "hubs" connecting outlying branches of the graph to the more highly connected centre.
* __Spinglass__ [@reichardt_statistical_2006]. This algorithm uses a more abstract approach to community detection. Briefly, it uses ideas from statistical physics/mechanics to identify groups of nodes which are in some way "similar". In this context it is difficult to suggest a practical intuition which can be used to describe the algorithmic approach. 


```r
# Hierarchical methods - use cut_at to chop up
# Use distances to help create clusters
clust_w <- cluster_walktrap(tfl_graph, steps = 10, weights = E(tfl_graph)$dist)
clust_eb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(tfl_graph, directed = T, weights = E(tfl_graph)$dist)
# n.b. spins sets number of clusters
clust_sg <- cluster_spinglass(tfl_graph, spins = 10, weights = E(tfl_graph)$dist)
```

As both the _walktrap_ and _edge betweenness_ algorithms are hierarchical, the results were used to create a specified number of communities. The _spinglass_ algorithm has a parameter which was used to pre-specify the number of communities. In each case, ten station communities were specified in order to draw comparisons with the existing ten fare zones. 


```r
# Create dataframe of results
station_cluster_stats <- data_frame(station = names(V(tfl_graph)),
                                   eb = cut_at(clust_eb, no = 10),
                                   walk = cut_at(clust_w, no = 10),
                                   sg = membership(clust_sg))
```

## Comparisons with reality

### Basic similarity measures

Salton's cosine similarity[-@Salton:1986:IMI:576628] measure was used to compare the differences in importance-based fare zones. Such comparisons were made both between each zoning approach, and with the existing fare-zones.


```r
cosines <- station_importance_zones %>% 
         left_join(station_details %>% select(name_cln, zone_cln),
                    by = c("station" = "name_cln")) %>% 
         rename(Betweenness = bet,
                Closeness = clo,
                Degree = deg,
                Eigenvector = eig,
                Zone = zone_cln) %>% 
         select(-station) %>% 
         as.matrix() %>% 
         lsa::cosine() %>% 
         round(3)
```

### Financial approach

Using the journeys data, it was possible to calculate the total fares charged to Oyster pay-as-you-go customers on each day of the week.


```r
# Group and total
journey_summaries <- journeys %>% 
    group_by(downo,
             daytype,
             start_zone,
             end_zone) %>% 
    summarise(journeys = n(),
              total_rev = sum(dfare, na.rm = TRUE) / 100) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(journeys_scaled = 20 * journeys,
           total_rev_scaled = 20 * total_rev,
           rough_cpj = total_rev_scaled / journeys_scaled)
```

Using a similar approach, it was also possible to estimate the cost of a single trip from any one zone to any other single zone.


```r
# Get rough zone-zone costs
zone_costs <- journeys %>% 
    group_by(start_zone,
             end_zone) %>% 
    summarise(journeys = n(),
              total_rev = sum(dfare, na.rm = TRUE) / 100) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(journeys_scaled = 20 * journeys,
           total_rev_scaled = 20 * total_rev,
           cpj = total_rev_scaled / journeys_scaled) %>% 
    select(start_zone, end_zone, cpj)
```

These zone-zone costs were then used (along with the sample journeys data) to estimate the total daily fare received under each alternative zoning approach. This was done by: 

* assuming the cost of each zone-zone ticket (based on the sample journey data) remained constant under each model; 
* iteratively changing the zone of each station based on the alternative approach being considered; and
* calculating the total fares charged per day based on the fixed zone-zone costs and alternative zoning approach being considered.


```r
# Create function to ease iteration over approaches
calculate_daily_fares <- function(how) {
    # the `how` argument will be one of the methods
    # either "current", "bet", "deg", "eig", or "clo"

    # Return "current" fares if requested

            summarise(total_fare_rev = sum(total_rev),
                      total_fare_rev_scale = sum(total_rev_scaled)) %>% 
            mutate(how = "current") %>% 
            ungroup()
} else {

methods <- c("current", "deg", "eig", "bet", "clo")

# Loop over each method/zoning approach
fare_estimations <- lapply(methods, calculate_daily_fares) %>% bind_rows()
```

The differences in estimated fares were also compared statistically using Tukey's [-@tukey_comparing_1949] "Honest Significant Difference" method.


```r
fit <- aov(total_fare_rev_scale ~ how, data = fare_estimations)
tukey <- TukeyHSD(fit, conf.level = 0.95)
tukey <- broom::tidy(tukey) %>% 
            select(-term, -conf.low, -conf.high) %>% 
            mutate(comparison = gsub("clo", "Closeness", comparison),
                   comparison = gsub("bet", "Betweenness", comparison),
                   comparison = gsub("eig", "Eigenvector", comparison),
                   comparison = gsub("deg", "Degree", comparison),
                   comparison = gsub("current", "Existing Zones", comparison),
                   estimate = round(estimate, 0),
                   adj.p.value = round(adj.p.value, 3))
```


The results of this analysis are presented in the results section.

### Graph theoretical approach

As the station communities were more arbitrarily defined than the importance-based zones, comparisons of estimated fares were not made. Instead, metrics suggested by 
Yang and Leskovec [-@yang_defining_2015] were used to measure the "goodness" of the detected communities. The same metrics were calculated for the existing fare zones and the results compared.

Yang and Leskovec [-@yang_defining_2015] state that "good" communities are small, with many links between nodes _within_ the community and a small number of links connected to other communities.

Amongst other metrics, they define the _density_ and _separability_ of a community:

\begin{equation}
Density = \dfrac{m_S}{n_s(n_s-1)/2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Separability = \dfrac{m_S}{c_S}
\end{equation}

Where $n_S$ is the number of nodes _within_ the community, $m_S$ the number of edges entirely within the community and $c_S$ the number of edges link the community to another community.

These metrics were calculated for each of the communities detected using the three algorithms mentioned above, as well as for the existing fare zones.


```r
get_cluster_stats <- function(how, data) {
# Function argument 'how' defines which community detection method (inc. current zone)
# should be used 
    
# Take created "zones" (clusters) and join in actual zones, gather into long table
    tmp_zones <- data %>% 
        left_join(station_details %>% select(name_cln, zone_cln),
                  by = c("station" = "name_cln")) %>% 
        gather(method, value, -station) %>% 
        filter(method == how) %>% 
        select(station, value) %>% 
        rename(zone = value)
    
    # Get stations per zone (n_s)
    stations_per_zone <- tmp_zones %>% count(zone)
    
    # Join in "zones" to links (edges)
    tmp_links <- links %>% 
        left_join(tmp_zones, by = c("station1" = "station")) %>% 
        rename(zone1 = zone) %>% 
        left_join(tmp_zones, by = c("station2" = "station")) %>% 
        rename(zone2 = zone)
    
    # Add zone-zone comparisons to get m_s and c_s
    tmp_links <- tmp_links %>% 
        mutate(ms = ifelse(zone1 == zone2, 1, 0),
               cs = ifelse(zone1 != zone2, 1, 0))
    
    # Aggregate across zone
    zone_summary <- tmp_links %>% 
        group_by(zone1) %>% 
        summarise(ms = sum(ms),
                  cs = sum(cs)) %>% 
        left_join(stations_per_zone, by = c("zone1" = "zone"))
    
    # Perform summaries
    zone_summary <- zone_summary %>% 
        mutate(Separability = ms / cs,
               Density = ms / (n*(n - 1) / 2),
               method = how)
    
    return(zone_summary)
}

methods <- c("zone_cln", "eb", "walk", "sg")
community_metrics <- lapply(methods, get_cluster_stats, 
                            data = station_cluster_stats) %>% bind_rows()
```

The statistical differences in these metrics were calculated for each of the community detection algorithms using Tukey's Honest Significant Differences.


```r
fit_sep <- aov(Separability ~ method, community_metrics)
tukey_sep <- TukeyHSD(fit_sep, conf.level = .95) %>% 
             broom::tidy() %>% 
             select(-term, -conf.low, -conf.high) %>% 
             mutate(comparison = gsub("eb", "Edge betweenness", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("walk", "Walktrap", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("sg", "Spinglass", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("zone_cln", "Existing Zones", comparison),
                    estimate = round(estimate, 3),
                    adj.p.value = round(adj.p.value, 4))

fit_den <- aov(Density ~ method, community_metrics)
tukey_den <- TukeyHSD(fit_den, conf.level = .95) %>% 
             broom::tidy() %>% 
             select(-term, -conf.low, -conf.high) %>% 
             mutate(comparison = gsub("eb", "Edge betweenness", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("walk", "Walktrap", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("sg", "Spinglass", comparison),
                    comparison = gsub("zone_cln", "Existing Zones", comparison),
                    estimate = round(estimate, 3),
                    adj.p.value = round(adj.p.value, 4))
```

# Results

## Importance-based zones

Station importance was found to vary substantially based on the metric used to calculate it. Figure 2 shows (normalised) station importance for each line in the TfL underground for each of the importance metrics used. Intuitively, in this setting, the four methods each measure different aspects of the TfL network. Closeness and eigenvector centrality measure how central a the proximity to central London and importance, respectively. Degree centrality could be imagined to measure the "usefulness" of each station, independant of the other stations it was connected to (with usefulness being directly proportional to the number of adjacent stations). Betweeness measures how much each station helps to connect the overall network, and could be used to identify critical points in the network. The analytical differences between these zones and the existing fare zones are presented below.

### Basic similarity

The importance-based zones did not appear to be geographically distinct from one another (appendix TODO) in the same way as the existing fare zones. However, when measured with Salton's [-@Salton:1986:IMI:576628] cosine measure, the zones defined using station importance metrics showed a high similarity with each other, and with the exising fare zones. This was slightly surprising given the forced, equal distribution of the number of stations in each importance-based zone (not the case for the existing zones).


```r
cosines %>% kable(caption = "Cosine similarity measures between zones defined using importance-based metrics and the existing TfL payment zones.")
```

               Betweenness   Closeness   Degree   Eigenvector    Zone
------------  ------------  ----------  -------  ------------  ------

Eigenvector centrality-based zoning produced the most similar results to the existing zones, and closeness-based zones also showed a high similarity with the existing zones. This was an intuitive result: the current fare zones are defined in some way based on a station's proximity to central London (similar to closeness) and it's importance in daily London life (similar to Eigenvector centrality). It therefore made sense that these two measures showed the most similarity with the existing model.

### Financial differences

Using the approach outlined previously, daily fares were estimated using each of the three importance-based zoning approaches and compared with the daily fares using the current fare-zoning method. The results of this comparison are presented in figure 3.

The alternative approaches consistently out-performed the current zoning approach when considering expected daily fares (Tfl Underground, Oyster-PAYG only). 

Zones created through closeness measures most closely matched the figures for the current zones, which was to be expected given the similarities in how they are defined (based on distance to all other stations). The increase in fares based on closeness zones relative to the current zone model was probably due to the equal distribution of stations to zones enforced by the decile-rank approach to creating the zones. 

Betweenness and degree centrality-based zones were found to perform "best", i.e. generated the highest fares. This is due to the fact that many of the stations have large differences in zone when moving from the importance-based to the current fare zone models (appendix TODO). For example, Regent's Park station is currently in fare zone 1 due to it's proximity to central London. However, as it is not a well-visited station on one of the less-busy lines (the Bakerloo line), it is placed in to zone 10 for by betweenness-based zoning. Eigenvector centrality-based zoning also out-performed the current fare zones and was found to produce results most similar to the existing zones. 

However, none of the differences in estimated fare were found to be statistically significant as measured by Tukey's Honest Significant Differences [-@tukey_comparing_1949] (table TODO).

The geographical distribution of communities defined using edge betweenness show the most similarity with the exising zones. There is a clear central zone, surrounded by radial/branch zones which could be broken down by geographic region or using a similar approach to that used for London postcodes. 

The walktrap algorithm did not performed well in this setting: there is little intuitive distinction between communities when viewed geographically.

Whilst not as geographically distinct as the edge-betweenness communities, the spinglass algorithm generated generated clear communities which could be used to create fare zones relatively simply. 

### Theoretical properties

The density and separability [@yang_defining_2015] metrics for each approach (along with the existing zones) are showm in figure TODO.

Discounting the walktrap algorithm (based on its poor performance when viewing the results geographically), the best approach appears to be the edge betweenness algorithm. It generates dense communities which are separable from each other. Spinglass also performed well, although the communities it detected were less dense and less separable thant those for edge-betweenness.

Both edge betweenness and spinglass generated communities which were more dense and more separable than the existing fare zones. The differences in density were not statistically significant when measured using Tukey's Honest Significant Differences (tables TODO and TODO), however edge betweenness produced significantly more separable clusters than the current zones. 

This results was not, however, particularly surprising as the existing zones were generated in such a different manner than the graph communities.
