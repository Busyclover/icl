Formulated as a multidimensional constrained minimisation model, the problem considers a multimodal transportation system under the assumption of elastic demand for simulating the impacts of fare policies on modal split and network performance. It was suggested that the proposed model is applied with the adoption of two objective functions in order to take into account all system and social costs: Firm costs and external costs. Numerical tests show that the main constraints in fare definition are related to the size of public transport subsidies provided by public administration.},

We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn{\textasciicircum}2) and space O(n{\textasciicircum}2) in the worst case, and in time O(n{\textasciicircum}2log n) and space O(n{\textasciicircum}2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph).

The community structure of the network is interpreted as the spin configuration that minimizes the energy of the spin glass with the spin states being the community indices. We elucidate the properties of the ground state configuration to give a concise definition of communities as cohesive subgroups in networks that is adaptive to the specific class of network under study. Further we show, how hierarchies and overlap in the community structure can be detected. Computationally effective local update rules for optimization procedures to find the ground state are given. We show how the {\textbackslash}textit\{ansatz\} may be used to discover the community around a given node without detecting all communities in the full network and we give benchmarks for the performance of this extension. Finally, we give expectation values for the modularity of random graphs, which can be used in the assessment of statistical significance of community structure.},

In this paper we study a set of 230 large real-world social,

nodes explicitly join various interest based social groups
. We
use such groups to define a reliable and robust notion of

We then propose a methodology which allows us to compare
and quantitatively evaluate how different structural defin

group into four classes. We find that two of these definitions,

Special focus is placed on how different equilibrium fares are linked to trip length. Higher operator costs and higher demand from the authorities regarding the quality of transport supply result in steeper relationships (larger rate of change) between all fares and travel distance. Also, a higher degree of substitutability between the services will in most cases make these relationships steeper. The competitive situation has less influence on fares, both absolutely and relatively, the longer routes the operators compete on.},

	abstract = {Rail service fares in Greater London and the surrounding area are calculated in accordance with the London fare zones system managed by Transport for London. Within London all London Underground, National Rail, London Overground, {TfL} Rail and Docklands Light Railway stations are assigned to nine fare zones. Fare zone 1 covers the central area and fare zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 form concentric rings around it. Some National Rail stations and all Transport for London served stations outside Greater London in the counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey are either included in fare zones 4,5 or 6 or in extended zones beyond these. Transport for London fare zones are also known simply as zones or travelcard zones, referring to their use in calculating prices for the travelcard product. Before flat fares were introduced in 2004, fare zones were used on the London Buses network. London fare zones are also used for calculating the cost of single and return paper tickets, Oyster card pay-as-you-go fares and season tickets. A special fare applies on travelling to the next station: Oyster Card:£1.50 (Off-peak)/£1.70 (Peak) Cash:£2.3 (No matter how many zones you cross.)},

	abstract = {Rapid transit, also known as metro, subway, heavy rail, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways.
Modern services on rapid transit systems are provided on designated lines between stations typically using electric multiple units on rail tracks, although some systems use guided rubber tyres, magnetic levitation, or monorail. The stations typically have high platforms, without steps inside the trains, requiring custom-made trains in order to avoid gaps. They are typically integrated with other public transport and often operated by the same public transport authorities. However, some rapid transit systems have at-grade intersections between a rapid transit line and a road or between two rapid transit lines. It is unchallenged in its ability to transport large numbers of people quickly over short distances with little use of land. Variations of rapid transit include people movers, small-scale light metro, and the commuter rail hybrid S-Bahn.
The world's first rapid-transit system was the partially underground Metropolitan Railway which opened as a conventional railway in 1863, and now forms part of the London Underground. In 1868, New York opened the elevated West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, initially a cable-hauled line using static steam engines.
The world's largest single rapid transit service provider by both length of track (842 miles (1,355 km), including non-revenue track) and number of stations (469 stations in total) is the New York City Subway. By length of passenger route, the world's longest single-operator rapid transit system is the Shanghai Metro. The busiest rapid transit systems in the world by annual ridership are the Tokyo subway system, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway, the Moscow Metro, the Beijing Subway, and the Shanghai Metro.},

	abstract = {Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.
The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. As a result, the shortest path algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably {IS}-{IS} and Open Shortest Path First ({OSPF}). It is also employed as a subroutine in other algorithms such as Johnson's.
Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time

This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can indeed be improved further as detailed in § Specialized variants.
In some fields, artificial intelligence in particular, Dijkstra's algorithm or a variant of it is known as uniform-cost search and formulated as an instance of the more general idea of best-first search.},

	abstract = {Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors at 90° have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. Cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in [0,1].
Note that these bounds apply for any number of dimensions, and cosine similarity is most commonly used in high-dimensional positive spaces. For example, in information retrieval and text mining, each term is notionally assigned a different dimension and a document is characterised by a vector where the value of each dimension corresponds to the number of times that term appears in the document. Cosine similarity then gives a useful measure of how similar two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter.
The technique is also used to measure cohesion within clusters in the field of data mining.
Cosine distance is a term often used for the complement in positive space, that is: 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            C

    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle D\_\{C\}(A,B)=1-S\_\{C\}(A,B)\}
  . It is important to note, however, that this is not a proper distance metric as it does not have the triangle inequality property and it violates the coincidence axiom; to repair the triangle inequality property while maintaining the same ordering, it is necessary to convert to angular distance (see below.)
One of the reasons for the popularity of cosine similarity is that it is very efficient to evaluate, especially for sparse vectors, as only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered.},
