# Social Networks, leadership and picking people

> Networking $\neq$ having networks. 

## Myth-busting

We do not have just one network. Instead we are members of many networks, e.g. work, school, home, social...

Our brains are excellent at searching our networks to _make connections_. 

Networking $\neq$ having networks. 

## Trends

There is a growing use of network analysis in the business world, e.g.

* Quid - use networks to spot new business opportunities;
* Ayasdi - analyse the shape of networks in life sciences to detect new molecules;
* Organising for Action - Formerly Obama for America, uses networks to mobilise people to vote (for Obama) and create political change;
* Palantir - use networks for infosec, externally and internally to an organisation.

Some concern over what our network can say about us, e.g. predicitive policing (tounge in cheek: Minority Report?), govt snooping.

## Concepts

There is strength in weak ties: we often get the most value from connections of connections. 

With strong ties wer are less likely to "trade" our resources. Strong ties are  mutual. A highly interconnected (many strong ties) network will work together well as the team knows each other, but may suffer from information redundancy and won't get new information regularly. 

> It's not _what_ you know, but _who_ you know.

Yes, __but__:

* Who else do they know that you don't;
* who else do you know that they don't;
* How well do they know you/like you/respect you;
* How long have you known them;
* How often do you talk.

There is usefulness in our network. They provide reach (to others), connection to power, and closeless. (Or not).

Networks are relevant to the spread of innovation, success in careers, satisfaction and health, power in business.
