# Document purpose

The purpose of this document is to write up the response to the third assignment given as part of the _Statistics and Econometrics_ module. It is divided in to two sections, each covering a section of the assignment as given. Each major section is divided in to further subsections, one for each question in the assignment.

A number of `R` packages have been used throughout this assignment. These are loaded before the responses are given:

```{r load_pkg, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
```

# Section 1

In this section, it is posited that data from a survery on wages, education, experience and gender is provided. In addition, data on marijuana use is also asked for. The question asked regarding marijuana use was:

> "On how many separate occasions last month did you smoke marijuana?"

## 1a

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1a}
log(wage) = \beta_0 + \delta_1 female + \beta_1 education + \beta_2 experience + \beta_4 marijuana
\end{equation}

If it is assumed that:

* gender is represented by a binary variable (named $female$) whereby a value of $1$ indicates female, and $0$ indicates male; and
* education, experience and marijuana are purely quantitaive variables named as such

then a simple equation such as \eqref{eq:1a} can be written to allow statements such as "Smoking marijuana five more times per month is estimated to change wage by x%". Note that the dummy variable $female$ contrasts the change in wage between genders (holding the other independant constant) with males as the base group.

## 1b

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1b}
log(wage) = \beta_0 + \delta_1 female + \beta_1 education + \beta_2 experience + \beta_4 marijuana + \delta_2 marijuana.female
\end{equation}

The regression function given in \eqref{eq:1b} would allow a test to be performed to understand if drug (marijuana) use has a different effect on wage for men and women. In \eqref{eq:1b} it is the $\delta_2$ parameter that describes this effect, it is the estimated change in the slope coefficient for marijuana use ($\beta_4$) for females over the reference group (males).

It would be possible to test that there are no differences in the effects of drug usage for men and women using the following hypothesis:

* $H_0:\delta 1 = 0$ and $\delta_2 = 0$, i.e. the wage is the same for men and women who have the same level of drug use.

For this hypothesis, an $F$-statistic could be generated to test for exclusion restrictions.
