# Document purpose

The purpose of this document is to write up the response to the third assignment given as part of the _Statistics and Econometrics_ module. It is divided in to two sections, each covering a section of the assignment as given. Each major section is divided in to further subsections, one for each question in the assignment.

A number of `R` packages have been used throughout this assignment. These are loaded before the responses are given:

```{r load_pkg, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
```

# Section 1

In this section, it is posited that data from a survery on wages, education, experience and gender is provided. In addition, data on marijuana use is also asked for. The question asked regarding marijuana use was:

> "On how many separate occasions last month did you smoke marijuana?"

## 1a

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1a}
log(wage) = \beta_0 + \delta_1 female + \beta_1 education + \beta_2 experience + \beta_4 marijuana
\end{equation}

If it is assumed that:

* gender is a binary variable named $female$ whereby a value of $1$ indicates female, and $0$ indicates male; and
* education, experience and marijuana are purely quantitaive variables

then a simple equation such as \eqref{eq:1a} can be written to allow statements such as "Smoking marijuana five more times per month is estimated to change wage by x%". Note that the dummy variable $female$ contrasts the change in wage between genders with males as the base group.
