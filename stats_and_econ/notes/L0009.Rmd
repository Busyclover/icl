# Model Specification and Data Issues

## Functional form misspecification

It is possible for non-linear relationships to be modelled using a linear regression, e.g. level-log models, quadratics, and interactions.

A regression is termed _misspecified_ if the functional form is incorrect and it fails to properly account for the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables. Misspecification __causes bias__.

Sometimes it is simply possible to use common sense/interpretation to identify misspecification, e.g. whether or not x should affect y in percentage (log) or absolute (level) terms, or for the derivative of $x_i$ to vary with x (quadratic) or with $x_2$ (interactions), or to be fixed. 

However, if the misspecification is caused by omitting a non-linear function of one or more of the regressors then a specific test can be performed.

### REgression Specification Error Test (RESET)

The key idea of the RESET test is that when the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ...$ is correct (i.e. it satisfies ZCM), no functions of the x's should be significant when added to the model. 

Similar to a white test, the _squared_ and _cubed_ fitted values (which are functions of x) should be insignificant. 

Following from this, the following is the procedure of the RESET test:

1. OLS the original model and save the fitted values, $\hat{y}$;
2. Test $H_0 : \delta_1 = 0, \delta_2 = 0$ in the expanded model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... _ \delta_1 \hat{y}^2 + \delta_2 \hat{y}^3 + error$. The F-stat follows an $F_{2, n-k-3}$ distribution under the null;
3. Reject $H_0$ when F > c ($F_{2, n-k-3}$ critical value)

Note that when testing more than one model at once with RESET, it is possible that RESET rejects both models, or neither.

## Tests against Non-nested models

If it can be said that Model B is a restricted version of Model A, then Model A "nests" Model B. Nested models can be tested using the standard exclusion F tests. However, for non-nested models this is not possible.

There are two tests for testing non-nested models:

### Comperehensive Model

In this approach, a __comprehensive model__ is created that nests both of the two non-nested models. This approach may be used if it is uncertain whether x variables should be in log-form or not, creating two competing models:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:non_log}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + u
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:log}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 log(x_1) + \beta_2 log(x_2) + u
\end{equation}

The comprehensive model is written as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:comprehensive}
y = \gamme_0 + \gamma_1 x_1 + \gamma_2 x_2 + \gamma_3 log(x_1) + \gamma_4 log(x_2) = u
\end{equation}

The acceptance of the null $H_0 : \gamma_1 = \gamma_2 = 0$ suppports \eqref{eq:log} whereas the acceptance of the null $H_0 : \gamma_3 = \gamme_4 = 0$ supports the first model.

### Davidson-MacKinnon Test

Here, the competing models are also given by \eqref{eq:non_log} and \eqref{eq:log}. In this instance, the fitted values from these two models are termed $g$ and $h$ respectively. 

If the first model \eqref{eq:non_log} is correct then $h$ should be insignificant in \eqref{eq:dm}. I.e. rejecting $H_0 : \theta = 0$ is a rejection of the first model, \eqref{eq:non_log}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dm}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \theta h + u
\end{equation}.

__A clear winner may not emerge.__
