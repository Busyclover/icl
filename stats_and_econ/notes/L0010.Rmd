# Limited Dependent Variables

## Binary dependant variables

Recall that binary dependant variables can be modelled using a linear probability model (LPM) where y either equals 0 or 1, $P(y = 1 | x) = E(y|x) = \beta_0 + ...$

The LPM has several drawbacks including the fact that predicted values are not constrained from 0 to 1, it violates the assumption of homoskedasticity, and it assumes there is a constant marginal effect of the independant variables.

As such, an alternative to the LPM is to use a probability _function_ to describe the data, __G(z)__ (where $z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_kx_k$). Such a function is bounded [0, 1], i.e. $0\leq G(z) \leq 1$.

### Logit model

In the logit model, the __logistic function__ is used, which is the cumulative distribution function for a standard logistic ramdon variable.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:logit}
G(z) = \dfrac{exp(z)}{1+exp(z)}
\end{equation}

### Probit model

In the probit model, a function is used which describes the __standard normal__ cumulative distribution function.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:probit}
G(z) = \Phi(z) = \int_{-\inf}^z \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}exp(-\dfrac{v^2}{2})dv
\end{equation}

Both of these functions have similar shapes, they increaseing in z, most quickly around 0. They are both _nonlinear_ and require __maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)__ to solve. There is no reason to prefer one over the other (they return similar answers), however the logit model is computationally more simple.

## Latent variables

Binary models can be thought of as being motivated by _latent variables_. In this setting, it is imagined that there is an underlying (latent) variable, $y^*$ that can be modelled as $y^* = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_kx_k + u$ but for which we only _observe_ $y=1$ if $y^* > 0$ and $y=0$ if $y^*\leq 0$. 

Using logit or probit, u has either a standard logistic or standard normal distribution, respectively. In either case, u is symmetrically distributed about zero, which leads to \eqref{eq:equality} for an real all real number, z.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:equality}
1-G(-z) = G(z)
\end{equation}

Following from \eqref{eq:equality}, it is possible to define the probability for y:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:prob}
