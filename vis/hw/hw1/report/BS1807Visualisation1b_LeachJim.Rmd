# Introduction

## Background

This assignment deals with developing intimacy with data and establishing editorial perspectives. Two data sets were provided, both covering Olympics medal winners for a range of Olympic years and events. The task was to examine the data and understand what was they showed; to propose transformations/additions that could be made; to (visually) explore the data using Excel/Tableau; and to set out at least 5 distinct editorial perspectives that could be taken with the data.
