# Data description

Data from a DVD rental business were provided. The data contained information on customers, stores and the films that the customers rented. The data were provided as a database backup file which was loaded in to a simple _PostgreSQL_ database for the assignment.

# The assignment

Six questions were asked of the data. `SQL` queries were written to address these quetsions and the responses given below.

# Results

## Question One

> Find all films not in the inventory and count them

### Query

```
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT F.FILM_ID) AS MISSING_FILMS
FROM
	FILM F
LEFT JOIN
	INVENTORY I
ON F.FILM_ID = I.FILM_ID
WHERE I.FILM_ID IS NULL
```

### Result

> 42

\pagebreak

## Question Two

> Count	the	number	of	transactions	each	staff	has	been	processing	and	find	
the	 staff	 member	 (id)	 with	 the	 biggest	 number	 of	 transactions	 and	 also	
the	staff	member	with	the	biggest	sum	of	the	transaction	value.	

### Query

```
WITH STAFF_TO_TRANSAC AS
(
SELECT
	 STAFF_ID
	,COUNT(DISTINCT PAYMENT_ID) AS TRANSACTIONS
	,SUM(AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_TRANSACTIONS
FROM
	PAYMENT
GROUP BY
	STAFF_ID
)

SELECT * 
FROM 
	STAFF_TO_TRANSAC
WHERE TRANSACTIONS = (SELECT MAX(TRANSACTIONS) FROM STAFF_TO_TRANSAC)
AND TOTAL_TRANSACTIONS = (SELECT MAX(TOTAL_TRANSACTIONS) FROM STAFF_TO_TRANSAC)
```

### Result

```{r show_result2, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
res2 <- data.frame(id = 2, trans = 7304, amt = 31059.92)
kable(res2, col.names = c("Staff ID", "Transactions", "Total Transaction Value"))
```

\pagebreak

## Query Three

> Find	all	stores	with	more	than	300	customers.	Report	the	ID	of	the	store.			

### Query

```
SELECT
	 STORE_ID
	,COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) AS CUSTOMERS
FROM
	CUSTOMER CUST
GROUP BY STORE_ID
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) >= 300
```

### Result

> Store ID: 1, customers: 326

	,SUM(AMOUNT)
FROM
	PAYMENT
GROUP BY 
	CUSTOMER_ID
HAVING SUM(AMOUNT) >= 200
```

### Result

```{r show_res4, echo = FALSE}
res4 <- data.frame(id = c(526, 148), amt = c(208.58, 211.55))
kable(res4, col.names = c("Customer ID", "Amount Spent"))
```

\pagebreak

## Query 5

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT FILM_ID) AS FILMS
FROM 
	FILM
WHERE RENTAL_RATE > (SELECT AVG(RENTAL_RATE) FROM FILM)
```

### Result

> 659


\pagebreak

## Query 6

> Find	 films	 that	 have	 return	 date	 between	 2005-05-29	 and	 2005-05-30

### Query

```
SELECT DISTINCT
	TITLE
FROM
	FILM
WHERE FILM_ID IN
(
	SELECT DISTINCT FILM_ID
	FROM
		RENTAL R
	LEFT JOIN
		INVENTORY I
	ON R.INVENTORY_ID = I.INVENTORY_ID
	WHERE CAST(RETURN_DATE AS DATE) BETWEEN '2005-05-29' AND '2005-05-30'
)
```

### Result

There are 164 films returned by this query. They are listed below:
