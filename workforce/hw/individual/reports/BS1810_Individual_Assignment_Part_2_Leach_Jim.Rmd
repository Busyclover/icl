# Introduction

This report outlines my response to the second question set as part of the Workforce Analytics individual assignment. The question that I imagined asking was "How can we measure employee satisfaction at a more individual level in order to reduce employee turnover?"

## Side note

Please note that the word limit was discussed with Professor Al-Nauimi who stated that slightly more than 300 words was acceptable.

# Workforce Satisfaction

Workforce satisfaction is notoriously hard to measure. Many companies struggle to identify unhappy employees until it is too late. Employee turnover is costly. A method for estimating satisfaction to help retain staff is therefore highly desirable. 

Typically^3,4^, companies use broad-brush satisfaction surveys. But as several sources^2,5^ note, satisfaction is actually a combination of workplace happiness and _engagement_. It is the latter area that has more scope for innovation in satisfaction measurement at a personal level.

Some data sources relating to employee engagement are:

* The number of training events (especially self-selected) attended each year;
* The amount of "extra-curricular" work taken on (e.g. staff groups, industry events);
* The extent of non-work website visits / computer activity; 
* The presence of indicative key words in dictionaries created from comments in staff surveys/performance reviews etc.; and 
* Employee interaction tracking (as discussed by Alex Pentland in a HBR article^6^).

Motivation theories could be applied to use these data to define individual employee "types". Example "types" are those proposed by Theresa Welbourne at the University of Chicago^1^:

```{r show_tbl, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(magrittr)
data.frame(Segment = c("Survivalist", "Seeker", "Contributor", "'Fun'damentalist"),
           Mot = c("Need for income to survive", 
                   "Need for good pay coupled with personal satisfaction", 
                   "Need to 'make a difference' and not motivated by money", 
                   "Need for work to be fun, enjoy what they do, helps others and part of the work social scene")) %>%
kable(col.names = c("Segment", "Motivated by"),
      caption = "Employee types and motivations. Sourced from reference (1)")
```

Typical measures of performance and information such as tenure, salary, promotions etc, could also be use in this process. For example, an individual attending many training events, with limited non-work website use, and a dictionary containing certain key words (e.g. "motivated", "challenging") could be classified as a "Seeker". Alternatively an employee with a high attendance at "extra-curricular" activities, dictionary keywords such as "sharing", "public speaking" may be seen as "Contributors". Finally an employee with strong-interpersonal interactions or many office friends but a lower-than-average salary may be classified as a 'Fun'damentalist.

These classifications could be combined with conventional survey results to create more personalised satisfaction scores. These scores could be used to take more targeted action on increasing satisfaction.

The strengths of this method are that the more personal measurement of satisfaction may help to identify employees who would otherwise have been overlooked, and who are at risk of leaving (perhaps those who are more reserved). This would allow preventative action to be taken. Similarly, if warning signs were detected earlier rather than later, the firm may save time and/or money in negotiations trying to retain an employee who was already set on leaving.

Some limitations of this method include the difficulties in tracking some information (such as attendance at external training course or events) and potential privacy concerns around tracking computer use and workplace interactions. Moreover, employees may object to being "labelled" or "classified" in to a distinct personality type which may actually have the unwanted side effect of causing a reduced satisfaction simply by proposing this method.
