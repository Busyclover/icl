* Work placement position: Adjunct Data Scientist, Algorithms Team

## Project summary

Teams within Sainsbury's use customer complaints in order to work with suppliers to address issues arising with their products. This work is ongoing, occurring on a weekly basis, and highly manual. The large number of complaints received for high-sales-volume departments, coupled with low-quality of the customer comments (for example, one/two-word complaints, or complaints with numerous typographical errors) makes this process difficult. Consequently, emerging and significant issues with products are hard to identify and time-consuming to resolve. 

I was responsible for a six-week project analysing the text of customer complaints, working for an internal client responsible for monitoring and resolving complaints. The goal was to develop automated, algorithmic methods for detecting topics from free-text complaint comments. The algorithm needed to be developed, trained and refined using a factorial experiment approach. Additional, business-led hypotheses were generated and tested using the topics detected. This enabled teams working with complaints data to better understand the complaints received and, crucially, to be able to take more focussed actions to remedy problems with suppliers. 

The project was highly successful. I developed, trained, and refined an algorithm that detected topics in millions of historical complaints. The algorithm ran end-to-end in around 20 minutes, which represented a significant reduction in time compared to current review methods (which can take up to 1.5 days per week for teams receiving a few _thousand_ complaints per week). The additional hypothesis testing was also very successful and generated several informative outcomes that were highly revelant to the business, and could be used to inform and improve their complaints-handling processes. The Algorithms team and the internal client were pleased with both my performance, and the results produced.

## Knowledge Objectives

### Analysis of real, business related problems

Improving customer satisfaction is a key business objective for Sainsbury's. Reviewing and resolving complaint issues is an important part of accomplishing this objective. The current business processes used to review complaints and resolve issues with suppliers are slow and highly manual. As such, any methods to better understand complaints are highly desirable and could help address a key business objective. Moreover, complaint volumes are a key metric used in performance monitoring and so helping to reduce them could significantly boost internal performance measures.

The results of my project, therefore, could have a significant impact on a real, business related problem that Sainsbury's deals with on a weekly basis. 

### Application of MSc. module knowledge to solve business tasks; and integration of theorectical knowledge with relevant practical skills

In order to solve the challenges presented on this assignment I had to use and integrate knowledge and skills obtained from the following MSc. modules:

* _Retail and Marketing Analytics_ - This module gave me an understanding of common terminology used in a retail context. This helped me to have conversations with other members of the team about projects that they were working on, and to make suggestions about aspects of their project that they had not considered. 

* _Very Large Data Management_ - I used skills from this module when creating a `PostgreSQL` database, loading data, performing sensible Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) steps in order to create a layered, relational data model; and to perform additional `SQL`-based data manipulations on the results obtained from topic-detection processes applied to customer complaint text.

* _Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning_ - I used the series of lectures given by Professor Benoit as a basis for the main body of work involving text analysis. I used `R` and Prof. Benoit's `quanteda` package to detect and create topics across complaints for thousands of product categories using collocation analysis, a method specifically discussed in class. I also explored other methods for topic detection discussed in class, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, but discarded them due to their weaknesses in this specific context. 

* _Logistics and Supply Chain Analytics_ - I used time series methods (discussed in the module in the context of forecasting demand) in order to detect trends and potential seasonality in the time series of complaints received. I performed these analyses using the `forecast` package in `R` that was introduced in this module.

* _Digital Marketing_ - After detecting topics in the complaints, I used market-basket frequent-item-set mining techniques (the _apriori algorithm_) in order to detect co-occurrence of individual topics in a single complaint. Understanding the various metrics involved (e.g. _support_ and _confidence_ of an item-set) enabled me to use these methods in a different context to those for which they were presented in class. I used `SQL` to prepare the data and the `arules` package in `R` in order to implement the _apriori_ algorithm.

* _Network Analytics_ - I also used network analytics to detect clusters of individual topics when assessing the co-occurrence of topics on a single complaint. I used network centrality measures to understand the most important topics in a product category and community detection algorithms to find clusters in the graph structure. I performed these analyses using the `igraph` package, accessing its functionality from `R`.

* _Visualisation_ - I used knowledge from this module to select the most appropriate visualisation methods for my results, and to inform choices of how to structure and present these visualisations. I used the `ggplot2` `R` package discussed in class for the majority of my visualisations. I also used `D3.js` and other `JavaScript` libraries discussed in the second half of the module in order to produce interactive visualisations for my final presentation.

### Management of line manager's, peer, and clients' expectations

At the beginning of the project my line manager and I met to discuss his expectations for me, and how I could achieve them. In the first week I met the internal client in order to understand their expectations for the project. I managed these expectations by attending daily stand-up meetings with my line manager and other members of the Algorithms team to keep them up to date on my progress. I met with my line manager in the third week (of six) to discuss my performance and ensure that I was meeting their expectations. I provided weekly, written updates to the internal client in order to keep them informed. I also met with members of the client's team several times throughout the project, helping to manage their expectations and ensure that my results were relevant to them.

## Learning Outcomes

### Problem solving skills

I solved problems on this project by:

* researching and reviewing different approaches to solving similar problems elsewhere;
* using experimental approaches to inform my decisions; and
* working collaboratively with my team, and with other Sainsbury's colleages in order to resolve issues.

Some examples of the approaches are presented below.

__Research and review__: An intial problem on this project was the selection of an appropriate algorithm for detecting topics in complaint text. In order to solve this issue I consulted my lecture notes, and read articles both online and in scientific journals, and discussed the problem with the team I was working with. This gave me an understanding of what methods _could_ be used. I then performed some initial testing of these methods, evaluating them based on several factors including the quality of their results (i.e. how useful were the outputs for addressing the business issue) and their computational complexity. This enabled me to select the algorithm I would use to detect topics in the complaints. 

__Experimental approach__: After selecting the algorithm I was going to use, I then enountered another problem: how to aggregate complaints in order to detect the "best" topics possible. In order to address this problem, I implemented a simple factorial experiment. I compared the results from this experiment both quantitatively and qualitatively with other members of the team. I then selected the approach that had produced the 

__Working collaboratively__: I also encountered problems caused by the messy nature of the data that I was using (abbreviations, negations, synonyms etc.). After devising some simple methods to address these issues I validated my approach with colleagues in my team, and (crucially) with members of the team that I was working for. This approach worked well. I was able to solve the problem and inclusion of the team I was working for meant that my approach was best suited to their needs and solving their business problem.

### Analytics skills to select and use relevant information

TODO

### Communication and presentation skills to produce a report

The Algorithms team held informal daily stand-up meetings. We discussed the status of each of our projects and any problems that we were encountering. At times myself or other team members made suggestions for others' projects or asked for advice on tricky problems we were facing. I had several, more formal meetings with members of the Algorithms team to discuss my project and ideas for approaches I could take. At these meetings I was clear and concise, and communicated effectively with my team members. 

I had several meetings with the internal client. These gave me the opportunity to understand the project requirements in more detail, and to communicate directly with senior members of Sainsbury's head-office staff. I was effective in these meetings, building rapport whilst focussing on what was relevant to both them and myself for the projet I was working on.

I also gave a major presentation to the internal analytics community in my final week. I presented my results and findings, and walked through the steps I had taken at various stages of the project. During this presentation I was engaging and communicated effectively to a large audience. This presentation was very successful, the audience was engaged and interested in the work that I had performed, and the Algorithms team received several requests for follow-on work from other departments based on this presentation. 

### Project management skills

__Initiate__: Formal project initiation was not required on my part: the project had been discussed and planned by the Algorithms team and its internal clients before my arrival at Sainsbury's. As such there was a well-defined statement of work for me to follow with a set of specific aims and requirements for the project. However, I did hold a meeting with the client and members of their team in my first week in order to better understand the project and discuss _how_ we were going to approach it.

__Perform__: As well as daily stand-up meetings held within the Algorithms team, I provided a weekly update slide to my team and the internal client detailing the status of the project. This weekly update was aligned to the statement of work, ensuring that set-requirements were met. This meant that my time and my client were kept informed of progess regularly, and any problems could be overcome or resolved in a timely fashion. I held meetings with the internal client throughout the project to ask questions, and present intermediate results to ensure that my work aligned to their objectives.

__Close__: I produced a final written report and delivered this to the internal client, walking them through the approach and the results. I presented my work to the internal analytics community. I wrote detailed documentation for handing over my work to other members of the Algorithms team and provided a method for automating the algorithm I had developed.
